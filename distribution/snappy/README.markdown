Remaining tasks
---------------

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/join-snapcrafters/1325)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so hello-c-world can authoritatively publish future releases.

-   [x] Fork the [Snapcrafters template](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me) repository to your own GitHub account.
    -   If you have already forked the Snapcrafter template to your account and want to create another snap, you'll need to use GitHub's [Import repository](https://github.com/new/import) feature because you can only fork a repository once.
-   [ ] ~~Rename the forked Snapcrafters template repository~~
-   [x] Update the description of the repository
-   [x] Update logos and references to `[Project]` and `[my-snap-name]`
-   [x] Create a snap that runs in `devmode`
-   [ ] Register the snap in the store, **using the preferred upstream name**
-   [ ] Add a screenshot to this `README.md`
-   [ ] Publish the `devmode` snap in the Snap store edge channel
-   [ ] Add install instructions to this `README.md`
-   [ ] Update snap store metadata, icons and screenshots
-   [ ] Convert the snap to `strict` confinement, or `classic` confinement if it qualifies
-   [ ] Publish the confined snap in the Snap store beta channel
-   [ ] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
-   [ ] Post a call for testing on the [Snapcraft Forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io) \- [link](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master)
-   [ ] Ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to fork your repo into github.com/snapcrafters, transfer the snap name from you to snapcrafters, and configure the repo for automatic publishing into edge on commit
-   [ ] Add the provided Snapcraft build badge to this `README.md`
-   [ ] Publish the snap in the Snap store stable channel
-   [ ] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
-   [ ] Post an announcement in the [Snapcraft Forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io) \- [link](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master)
-   [ ] ~~Submit a pull request or patch upstream that adds snap install documentation - [link](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master)~~
-   [ ] ~~Submit a pull request or patch upstream that adds the `snapcraft.yaml` and any required assets/launchers - [link](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master)~~
-   [ ] ~~Add upstream contact information to the `README.md`~~
-   If upstream accept the PR:
    -   [ ] ~~Request upstream create a Snap store account~~
    -   [ ] ~~Contact the Snap Advocacy team to request the snap be transferred to upstream~~
-   [ ] Ask the Snap Advocacy team to celebrate the snap - [link](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master)
