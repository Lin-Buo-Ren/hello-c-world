 # preprocessed-source-code

This folder contains the preprocessed source code by the C preprocessor, in GCC, this is `cpp`.  The preprocessor recursively extracts contents from each `#include` directive into the source code.

The preprocessed source code's filename extension is `.c`, since it is still in C programming language.
